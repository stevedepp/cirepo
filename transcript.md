**slide 1:**  

Hello everyone.  This is Steve Depp.  Thank you for watching my demo video of Continuous integration.  This video covers 3 demos

1. 	making a continuous integration repo
2.	developing its features 
3.	releasing a production version of that repo

... all of course with integration between GitHub versioning and Circle CI for continuous automatic build and test.

**slide 2:**  

The first demo is 21 steps from opening the repo on GitHub and following it on CircleCi ...  

**slide 3:**  

... to generating the code ...   

**slide 4:**  

... and inspecting the results ...   

**slide 5:**  

There were some hiccups but all those were sorted.
 
**slide 6:**  

The second demo is developing features for the repo in 23 steps: from setting up a feature branch for the repo ... 

**slide 7:**  

... to developing code in the form of a command line tool that runs a simple web app ... 
 
**slide 8:**  

... to demoing these features ...

**slide 9:**  

... and closing the ticket after a branch merge ...

**slide 10:**  

There were hiccups here too, but live and learn.

**slide 11:**

the 3rd demo releases the application employing mostly terminal commands ...

**slide 12:**  

... that merge the development and production branches ...

**slide 13:**  

... with success

**slide 14:**  

Thank you for watching my video.  I will post this video on the discussion board with the GitHub address that has all 54 steps laid out.
